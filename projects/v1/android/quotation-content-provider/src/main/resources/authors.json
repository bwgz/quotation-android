While best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc², he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.\nNear the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led to the development of his special theory of relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe."}],"valuetype":"string"},"/people/person/quotations":{"count":194.0,"values":[{"creator":"/user/faye","id":"/m/02kpjhq","lang":"en","text":"Imagination is more important than knowledge.","timestamp":"2007-06-16T01:53:55.011Z"},{"creator":"/user/faye","id":"/m/02kpjn_","lang":"en","text":"Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.","timestamp":"2007-06-16T01:53:56.003Z"},{"creator":"/user/ajpaget","id":"/m/02nrfj2","lang":"en","text":"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.","timestamp":"2007-07-15T17:29:28.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048g4ql","lang":"en","text":"This is what the painter, the poet, the speculative philosopher, and the natural scientists do, each in his own fashion.","timestamp":"2008-07-02T20:55:59.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048f_qs","lang":"en","text":"The ideals which have always shone before me and filled me with the joy of living are goodness, beauty, and truth.","timestamp":"2008-07-02T20:55:59.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048jglf","lang":"en","text":"In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.","timestamp":"2008-07-02T20:55:59.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048f69b","lang":"en","text":"Creating a new theory is not like destroying an old barn and erecting a skyscraper in its place.

At various points in his life he considered himself a liberal, a socialist, and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had never been any of these in any profound sense. He was born in Monmouthshire, into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in Britain.\nRussell led the British \"revolt against idealism\" in the early 20th century. He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege and his protégé Ludwig Wittgenstein. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians. He co-authored, with A. N. Whitehead, Principia Mathematica, an attempt to ground mathematics on logic. His philosophical essay \"On Denoting\" has been considered a \"paradigm of philosophy\". His work has had a considerable influence on logic, mathematics, set theory, linguistics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and philosophy, especially philosophy of language, epistemology, and metaphysics.\nRussell was a prominent anti-war activist; he championed anti-imperialism and went to prison for his pacifism during World War I. Later, he campaigned against Adolf Hitler, then criticised Stalinist totalitarianism, attacked the involvement of the United States of America in the Vietnam War, and was an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament. In 1950 Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought.\""}],"valuetype":"string"},"/people/person/quotations":{"count":113.0,"values":[{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048gwls","lang":"en","text":"A truer image of the world, I think, is obtained by picturing things as entering into the stream of time from an eternal world outside, than from a view which regards time as the devouring tyrant of all that is.","timestamp":"2008-07-02T20:58:03.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048j_37","lang":"en","text":"One of the signs of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important.","timestamp":"2008-07-02T20:58:03.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048ghst","lang":"en","text":"The good life is one inspired by life and guided by knowledge.","timestamp":"2008-07-02T20:58:03.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048d7yg","lang":"en","text":"Indignation is a submission of our thoughts, but not of our desires.","timestamp":"2008-07-02T20:58:03.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048gcxn","lang":"en","text":"Our instinctive emotions are those that we have inherited from a much more dangerous world, and contain, therefore, a larger portion of fear than they should.","timestamp":"2008-07-02T20:58:03.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048d0yy","lang":"en","text":"Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth more than ruin more even than death.

RA was a British politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. Widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century, Churchill was also an officer in the British Army, a historian, a writer, and an artist. He is the only British Prime Minister to have received the Nobel Prize in Literature, and was the first person to be made an honorary citizen of the United States.\nChurchill was born into the aristocratic family of the Dukes of Marlborough, a branch of the Spencer family. His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a charismatic politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer; his mother, Jennie Jerome, was an American socialite. As a young army officer, he saw action in British India, The Sudan, and the Second Boer War. He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote books about his campaigns.\nAt the forefront of politics for fifty years, he held many political and cabinet positions. Before the First World War, he served as President of the Board of Trade, Home Secretary, and First Lord of the Admiralty as part of the Asquith Liberal government. During the war, he continued as First Lord of the Admiralty until the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign caused his departure from government. He then briefly resumed active army service on the Western Front as commander of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers. He returned to government as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, and Secretary of State for Air. After the War, Churchill served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Conservative government of 1924–29, controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy. Also controversial was his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII."}],"valuetype":"string"},"/people/person/quotations":{"count":189.0,"values":[{"creator":"/user/robert","id":"/m/03m2fll","lang":"en","text":"Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.","timestamp":"2008-02-14T00:39:57.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/faye","id":"/m/02kpjj0","lang":"en","text":"Never, never, never give up.","timestamp":"2007-06-16T01:53:55.011Z"},{"creator":"/user/mjrtdc","id":"/m/02n94n9","lang":"en","text":"I have always felt that a politician is to be judged by the animosities he excites among his opponents.","timestamp":"2007-07-05T08:50:39.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/robert_scarth","id":"/m/04ld2r","lang":"en","text":"This was their finest hour","timestamp":"2007-07-20T17:51:41.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048hnvf","lang":"en","text":"Personally, I'm always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught.","timestamp":"2008-07-02T20:56:26.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048h0qj","lang":"en","text":"I have not become the Kings First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire.","timestamp":"2008-07-02T20:56:26.000Z"},{"creator":"/user/quotationsbook","id":"/m/048jjxc","lang":"en","text":"The eagle has ceased to scream, but the parrots will now begin to chatter.
